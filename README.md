# Hello there, i'm Axonde ðŸŒŠ

I'm young software engineer, mostly based on web development (preferred front-end). Now learning c++, python, git, javascript and some other cool languages / libraries / technologies...

Like the Goggins world vision - **can't hurt me**.

And always remember: "If you think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture".

Thx to read this ðŸ™‚
